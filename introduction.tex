\section{Introduction}
Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) \cite{VLBIbook} is a type of
interferometry used in radio astronomy, in which data received at
several telescopes is combined to produce an image with very high
angular resolution. 
%\acomment{Remove.}{VLBI can be used for both astronomy and geodesy.  For
%astronomy, VLBI provides high-resolution images of radio sources in
%the sky, whereas in geodesy VLBI measures the location of the
%telescopes and the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP).}
This is important as recent astronomical research studies the deep-sky 
thus requiring high angular
resolution to capture all the details of the observed sources.
The angular resolution depends on the size of
the radio-telescope dish but due to mechanical constraints, it 
is difficult to build moveable telescope dishes with a size much
larger than 100m. With VLBI, it is possible to simulate a dish of a size 
equivalent to the maximal distance between the farthest telescopes; and
so, making virtual telescope with
a dish of a size of the Earth. In VLBI, several distant telescopes observe the same source, the signal are recorded and sent to a central facility for processing. The central step in processing the data is computing the correlation function between each pair of incoming signals. Within
the \scarie\ project we are developing and analyzing the capabilities
of software correlation using grids technologies. Given the amount of 
processing power needed for perform software correlation, we are distributing 
the computation using a master-worker approach. 

\scarie\ is a typical example of a recent trend of the e-Science 
community in which the worldwide computation centers and the 
scientific instruments are connected through high-speed networks. We think that to 
generalize the utilization of such world-size inter-connected facility, 
the grids and their middlewares have to offer services that matches the three
following important aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{performances}: solving bigger problem imply to use larger and/or
  more efficient hardware. 
\item \emph{isolated environment}: some users requires guarantee of isolated 
  execution environment in which the users'application cannot interfere. This is 
the case for real-time application or benchmarks.
\item \emph{scheduling}: may be needed when application requires to be synchronized
  with "external events": like a radio-telescope observing at specific date. 
\end{itemize}
In \scarie\ we are facing these three challenges, as we want to build a 
high-performance software correlator compatible with a real-time VLBI 
observation. These three aspects are hot-topics in the grid community,
especially the networking side; probably because worldwide networking (Internet) 
has a long history in being a best-effort shared resource. As best-effort 
is not compatible with isolated-environment we are conducting our 
experiments using the experimental \das3\ grids and its an
user-controllable dynamic photonic network called StarPlane that could permit 
us to build, on demand and application specific, isolated virtual-network 
on top of the complete grid. \\


The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:vlbi}
contains a general introduction to VLBI and its recent development 
called \evlbi. Section~\ref{sec:softwarecorrelation} describes the 
architecture of the software correlator. Section~\ref{sec:network} 
describes experiments and benchmark on executing \scarie on StarPlane 
\das3. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} give future work and conclusion.
