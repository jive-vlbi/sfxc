%%%
% Uncomment if you want a ruled line above the footnote.
%\let\footnoterule\savefootnoterule

% Bibliography Style Settings:
% ============================
% Choose either kluwerbib or normallatexbib:

%%%
%\kluwerbib % will produce this kind of bibliography entry:

% [1] Anderson, Terry L.,
%     continuing bib entry

% \cite{xxx} will print with square brackets around the citation, i.e., [1].

% Any \verb+\bibliographystyle{}+ may be used with \verb+\normallatexbib+, but
% you should check with your editor to find the style preferred for

\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we present the progress of the \scarie\ project. In
  which, we investigate the capabilities of a next generation
  grid based software correlator for VLBI. We will mostly focus on the
  current design of our software correlator, and on the challenges of
  running real-time scientific experiments on top of grids
  infrastructure. This paper also contains experimental results on
  both software correlation as well our current experiments on the
  DAS-3 grid and StarPlane its user-controllable dynamic photonic
  network.
