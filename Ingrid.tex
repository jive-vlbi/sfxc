\maketitle

\abstract{Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is a technique in
  astronomy where several distant radio telescopes observe the same
  source and the received signals are recorded and later correlated to
  produce an image with a large resolution. 

  The primary task of JIVE is the correlation of data from the EVN
  telescopes \cite{EVN} all around Europe. A special-purpose built
  hardware correlator processes the experiments. We are currently
  investigating the capabilities of a next generation software
  correlator using Grid processing power. In this paper we describe
  the design of this software correlator and some experimental
  results.}
