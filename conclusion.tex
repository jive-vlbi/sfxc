\section{Conclusion and future work}\label{sec:conclusion}
In the last year we laid the foundation for a flexible software
correlator based on distributed computing technologies. \acomment{Damien: }{Saying that it is now deliverable state.} Using this
software correlator we are currently collaborating intensively with
the StarPlane project in order to test incoming network with
guarenteed Quality of Services for grid.

\paragraph{Future work}
Within \scarie\ and a related project FABRIC, which is a joint
research activity in the EXPR{\it e}S project, we are currently
improving and testing more intensively the software correlator. \acomment{Damien:}{ 
Saying we can see several way to improve the speed at at least 6x. }

On the batch processing aspect of \scarie~ we want to investigate 
how dynamical resources can be added during the application run time to 
accelerate the computation. This include node joining/leaving the calculus as well as
setting up lighpath between input-nodes and the joining nodes.

We also want to continue our testing on the traffic isolation features of
the incoming networks as the one provided by Starplane. This include
interaction with network service providers as well as on experiencing
networking protocols to optimize the data transfer (using UDP instead
of TCP).
