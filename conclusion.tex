\section{Conclusion and future work}\label{sec:conclusion}
In the last year we laid the foundation for a flexible software
correlator based on distributed computing technologies. \scarie\ is
now useable for batch correlation and is used for ftp-fringe tests for
the EVN.

In order to reach our real-time correlation goal, we are collaborating
intensively with the StarPlane project to test new network
architectures for grids with guarenteed Quality of Services.

\paragraph{Future work}
Within \scarie\ and a related project FABRIC, which is a joint
research activity in the EXPR{\it e}S project, we are currently
improving and testing the software correlator. We still see
possibilities to improve the efficiency of the software correlator,
which we would like to investigate further.

On the batch processing aspect of \scarie\ we want to investigate how
resources can be added dynamically at runtime to accelerate the
computation. This include node joining and leaving as well as setting
up additional lighpaths to the new nodes.

On the real-time processing aspect, more work has to be done on the
traffic isolation features of the incoming networks as well as the
isolation provided by Starplane.
