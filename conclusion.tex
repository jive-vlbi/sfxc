\section{Conclusion and future work}
In the last year we have laid the foundation for a flexible software
correlator based on distributed computing technologies. Using this
software correlator we are currently collaborating intensively with
the StarPlane project in order to test incoming network with
guarenteed Quality of Services for grid.

\paragraph{Future work}
Within \scarie\ and a related project FABRIC, which is a joint
research activity in the EXPR{\it e}S project, we are currently
improving and testing the software correlator.

On the batch processing we want to investigate how dynamical resources
can be added during the application run time to accelerate the
computation. This include node joining/leaving the calculus as well as
setting up lighpath between input-nodes and the joining nodes.

We also want to continue our testing on traffic isolation features of
incoming networks like the one provided by Starplane. This include
interaction with network service providers as well as on experiencing
networking protocols to optimize the data transfer (using UDP instead
of TCP).
