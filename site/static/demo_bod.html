   The goal is to simulate an e-VLBI observation where data from radio telescopes across Europe (or across the globe) is sent to a compute cluster running the SFXC VLBI software correlator in order to be correlated in real-time. In this scenario we'd need the Bandwidth-on-Demand functionality to make sure that we do not lose any data while transferring the data (which is produced at a constant bit rate) from the telescopes to the correlator.

The simulation will use pre-recorded data distributed across some well-connected sites across Europe (or Europe + United States) that simulate the telescopes. The proposal is to correlate the signals from four telescopes, at a data rate of 256 Mbit/s per telescope (this is the data payload; the available bandwidth needs to be slightly larger to account for protocol overhead like TCP and IP headers), for about 10-15 minutes. If a longer demo is required, we can recorrelate the same data multiple times.
