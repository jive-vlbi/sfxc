/*
The wsdl2py tool should be used with a correct sequence and command line options.

example:

to generate the *services.py and *services_type.py files:

wsdl2py -bu .wsdl

to generate the *services_server.py file:

wsdl2dispatch --file .wsdl

then you can run a service (you should write one service python file) which 
simply runs and waits for an input from another python code that sends requests to
the running services.
